    * **Begin scaffolding out a decades long initative on eliminating global poverty.**
      * > I need a deeper awareness and understanding of the conditions of global poverty, microeconimics, conflict, healthcare & education in areas to combat this issue; along with this I'll need to network more. Poverty is most certainly the 21st Century's most prevalent issue, only in competition with environmentalism & sustainability, and key to solving poverty, especially in my own backyard in SF, one must understand that the problem or issue goes far beyond mental healthcare and/or finger pointing. Poverty stems from generations of economical, social & societal changes that pressure affected groups and regions, depriving many people of economic initiative, quality democratic systems, social good & awareness, education, longevity, nimble social & cultural mobility, and many more economic & social opportunities within wealthier communities.
    * **Begin figuring out what does a global healthcare system look like?**
      * > As billions of people are born in the 21st century and billions more age and live longer than the generations before them, how will they receive healthcare? Additionally the policies of the 21st century in healthcare that are being debated, refined & implemented on national scales may scale to supranational and/or scales.
